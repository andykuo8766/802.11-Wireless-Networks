## Ch1 Introduction to Wireless Networking

### Why Wireless?
* Advantages : 
    * Mobility
    * Flexibility

#### Radio Spectrum: The Key Resource
* Wireless devices are constrained to operate in a certain frequency band.
* Each band has an associated bandwidth, which is simply the amount of frequency space in the band.

#### The ISM bands
* I(industrial), S(Scientific), M(Medical)
* ISM bands allow license-free operation, provided the devices comply with power constraints.
    * 802.11b and 802.11g devices operate within the 2.4GHz ISM band
    * 802.11a devices operate in the 5GHz band.
